Bitcoin SV
===========

What is Bitcoin Cash?
---------------------

[Bitcoin Cash](https://www.bitcoincash.org/) is an experimental digital
currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. It
uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing
transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network.
Bitcoin Cash is a descendant of Bitcoin. It became a separate currency from
the version supported by Bitcoin Core when the two split on August 1, 2017.
Bitcoin Cash and the Bitcoin Core version of Bitcoin share the same
transaction history up until the split.

What is Bitcoin SV?
--------------------

Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (SV) is the name of open-source software which enables the use of
Bitcoin Cash. 

The source code was originally based on the [Bitcoin ABC](https://bitcoinabc.org)
software project.
